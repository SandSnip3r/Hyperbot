# RL UI Redesign Idea 3: Pairâ€‘Focused Split View

## Overview
- Main window shows two synchronized lists: one for Team A and one for Team B.
- Each row represents a pair; selecting a row fills the lower half of the window with detailed views for both characters side by side.
- The detail area includes tabs for status, inventory items, and RL preferences.

## Key Features
- **Split layout** emphasizes the 1v1 PVP nature, helping compare each pair directly.
- Tabs allow extra information without crowding the screen.
- State machine tree can appear in a dedicated tab with collapsible nodes.
- Inventory tab lists item counts and cooldown timers for important consumables.
- RL tab displays a bar chart of action preferences for quick analysis.

## Benefits
- Directly compares opponents, useful when debugging pair dynamics.
- Tabs keep the interface organized while exposing more depth.
- Works well whether controlling a few or many pairs by scrolling the upper lists.
