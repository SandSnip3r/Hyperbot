# RL UI Redesign Proposals

This folder collects several design ideas for improving the Hyperbot reinforcement learning UI. Each idea addresses the need for a concise fleet overview and quick access to detailed information about specific characters or pairs.

- [Idea 1](idea1.md) – Dashboard with expandable rows
- [Idea 2](idea2.md) – Card grid with live thumbnails
- [Idea 3](idea3.md) – Pair‑focused split view
- [Idea 4](idea4.md) – Multi‑window fleet manager

The operator can evaluate these options and mix the concepts that best fit the workflow.
