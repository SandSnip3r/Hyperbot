# RL UI Redesign Idea 4: Multi‑Window Fleet Manager

## Overview
- Introduce a dedicated "Fleet Manager" window containing a high‑level overview table similar to today.
- Each pair can be opened in its own floating window showing live data and controls.
- Windows can be arranged on multiple monitors to watch several battles simultaneously.

## Key Features
- **Fleet Manager** table lists all characters with filtering and sorting.
- **Detachable pair windows** provide full details including state machine tree, cooldowns, items, and RL preferences.
- Save and restore window layouts so an operator can keep favorite pairs visible.
- Global toolbar with quick actions (start/stop training, connect/disconnect, global pause).

## Benefits
- Flexible window arrangement for power users with large screens.
- Keeps the main manager lightweight while offering as much detail as needed per pair.
- Suitable for scenarios where dozens or hundreds of characters are active.
