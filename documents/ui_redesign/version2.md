# UI Redesign Proposal - Version 2: Expandable Grid

## Overview
This concept displays all characters in a grid. Each cell shows basic info and can expand in place to reveal more details.

## Fleet View
- Grid layout with character portraits and quick stats (HP, MP, state).
- Clicking a cell expands it to twice the size, revealing cooldowns and item counts.
- Multiple cells can be expanded at once for side-by-side comparison.

## Detail View
- Expanded cells show the full state machine tree and RL action preferences.
- Items and cooldowns are presented as small icon bars.

## Advantages
- Highly visual with minimal navigation.
- Scales to many characters by adjusting grid size.

## Drawbacks
- Can become cluttered if too many cells are expanded.
