# UI Redesign Proposal - Version 4: Tabbed Interface

## Overview
Characters are organized into tabs, allowing the operator to focus on specific groups or pairs while keeping the fleet overview readily accessible.

## Fleet View
- The first tab displays the full table of characters with sortable columns.
- Additional tabs can be created to monitor a subset of characters (e.g., a single PVP pair).

## Detail View
- Within a tab, selecting a character brings up a split view: list on the left, details on the right.
- Details include state machine hierarchy, key item cooldowns and RL action preferences.
- Tabs remember their layout so the user can switch contexts quickly.

## Advantages
- Easy switching between different character groups.
- Keeps the interface uncluttered by limiting how many characters are shown at once.

## Drawbacks
- Requires manual tab management as the number of characters grows.
