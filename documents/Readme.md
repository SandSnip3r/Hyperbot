# Documents

Here you can find various documentation I'm keeping on this project

### Current code
[Here](code.md) is some documentation on the current code structure from a couple different points of view (abstract and functional level).

### Functionalities and ideas
[Here](bot-ideas.md) is a document containing a ton of my ideas for the future of this bot. In this document, I've listed out a lot of functionalities that I'd like to achieve. For each of the functionalities, I've broken them down a bit into core requirements. This will be a good place for me to refer back to when I need to decide what to work on next.

### Code snippets
[The code directory](code) contains bits of code I write as POC or as an easier form of documentation.

### mBot
[This page](mBot.md) has screenshots showing the interface of a popular Silkroad bot called mBot.

### Questions
[This page](questions.md) will contain any questions on confusions I encounter and cant or dont need to immediately find an answer to.

### Dump
[This page](dump.md) is where I'll be putting my random ideas and thoughts to be organized later.
