# Hyperbot
This is a bot to automate everything a human player can do in an online MMORPG called [Silkroad Online](http://www.joymax.com/silkroad/).

## Silkroad
Silkroad Online is a historical fantasy MMORPG from Joymax based on the history of China along the famous Silk Road. Reproducing 7th century Silk Road trading while adding fantastic elements, Silkroad Online allows players to create their own characters, complete quests, fight monsters, level up, obtain pets, craft items, engage in PvP, and more.

The official Silkroad Online game no longer has an active community. The good news is that the private server community is huge. There is also a pretty big development community around this game which a lot of my work is based on.

The main components of the game worth automating are:
- Killing monsters
- Item management
- Equipment ehancements (alchemy)

### Other bots
There are a few popular bots that have been used by players such as:
- mBot
- Sbot
- Centerbot
- phBot
Some people have also made some tools like an automatic alchemy or auto staller.
