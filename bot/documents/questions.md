### These are just general questions I have

What is a global way to represent players? Is it an Id? Their username?

For example, if I wanted a function to block chat messages from a certain user

Am I going to have to provide timestamps with events?

How much state do I put into the Atomic Controllers? Any state kept is very likely to be duplicated at a higher level.
